Flask-CouchDB

This library helps you use CouchDB with Flask.

On Bitbucket:   http://bitbucket.org/leafstorm/flask-couchdb/
On PyPI:        http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-CouchDB
Documentation:  http://packages.python.org/Flask-CouchDB/

To build the docs, have Sphinx installed, change to the docs directory, and
run "make html".

The tests use nose, so have that installed and run "nosetests" to run them.

Thanks to Armin Ronacher for the logo.
